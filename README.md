## **Star Cinama**

Small cinema hall management project by using _**python.**_

After running the project, this will show you:

_**1\. VIEW ALL SHOWS TODAY**_  
_**2\. VIEW AVAILABLE SEATS**_  
_**3\. BOOK TICKET**_  
_**4\. Exit**_

You have to enter your choice, then the rest will come one by one.

Thank you.
